# What are containers and how to use them with CTF or in general

Containers often confuse people on how they work, what they do, and why they are used.

I will explain all three of these things, and by the end I will even have a lab for you to try out. Lets begin.

### Virtualization

In the context of computers, virtualization is a way to simulate/run an isolated system with allocated resources for that simulation. For example I can have my computer run two different operating systems at once, because I allocate parts of my resources such as storage, cpu, and ram, to be used to run this "simulation" or operating system, this operating system acts like a normal computer and independently uses its allocated resources to run. With virtualization you can do this with multiple systems and have your hardware split up into multiple simulations. This might sound weird at first but heres an analogy: Say you have one lagre grass field and there is soccer practice and football practice scheduled, What you can do is split the field in two , and the soccer team will do their own thing on one side while the football team does their thing on the other side. Same concept with virtualization.
