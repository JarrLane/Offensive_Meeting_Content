My notes from reading javascript tutorials from W3 schools.

These notes are scattered so proceed with caution

JavaScript is primarily used to program the behavior of web pages. We can use it to change the HTML that is displayed to us.
Typically we can see the javascript inserted within the HTML when we inspect a pages source using f12, this is contained within ```<script> </script>```. We can also find JavaScript contained in external files that are referred to, these files
end in .js, and we can refer to them in the html using src like so: ```<script src="myScript.js"></script>``` Along with that, we can also reference external js code.
by refering to a link that goes to js code or a file path to js code. 

To see the output/result of js code, we can use an html element, html output, alert boxes, or the browser console. (What is an HTML element? it is a part or section of the html that makes up a certain part of what we see, like a paragraph 
or maybe a header, it is made up of two tags, with the contwnt in the middle, so ```<p>This is paragraph content.</p>``` is an element and we use the tags p to know this is a paragraph, and the content inside is what makes up the paragraph,
we use multiple html elements to make up an html document, elements can also be "nested" or put inside each other) There is a method called innerHTMl that js will use to change the contents of an html element, and to access this element we
want to change we use document.getElementById(id), so here: 
```
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "<h2>js changed me from a blank element to this</h2>";
</script>
```
We reference the id of the paragraph element and change its contents, and we will see this change displayed to us. If we want to change just the text of an element we can use innerTEXT too. There is also document write, this will write to
html but it should be used with caution because if it is used after a page is loaded it gets rid of all the other html. Using window.alert or alert will show a popup of some output. console.log() can also display output in the console in the
browser, usually for debugging. 

Separate statements with ;

A variable defined with const cant be assigned a new value.

In js there are two types of values, fixed (wont change) and variable (can change). Fixed values are hard coded, or directly writen in the code, variables are declared, and hold whatever they are assigned. Use var and let to create variables. Any variable declered with const doesnt chabge its asssigned value. 

Js has 8 data types: string, number, Bigint, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Object. An object can be built-in (objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, etc.) or user defined. Js types are dynamic so one variable can hold different types, if it was static, the type of variable needs to be known at runtime but js is dynamic. Bigint stores higher numbers than the normal integer value. Objects are written in curly braces {}. An undefined variable has no value. You can empty a variable by setting it to undefined. 

To define an object, you can use an object literal, the new keyword, or a constructor. A literal is a list of key:values in curly braces. If you use the new keyword you create a new object, and then the object has data added to it after its creation. To access an objects property use object.property or object["property"]. Using "this" in an object references the object itself so if you see this.name in person its refering to person.name. Objects are containers for properties and methods, in js almost everything is an object. All values but primitives are objects. A primitive value has no properties or methods, this can be string number bool null undefined symbol or bigint. Objects are mutable so they can be changed. They are also passed by reference not value. This means an object assigned to two variables is not stored twice in memory as a copy for each variable, instead the two variables hold the address to the object in memory. Delete keyword deletes a property from an object. Nested objects means object inside an object. To access this nested object do family.pets.dog. Use constructors to create objects of the same type, this is a function. 

A constructor function looks like: 
```
function Person(name, age) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
}
```
"this" has no value, the value of "this" will become the new object when a new object is created.

Then use the new keyword to make a new object:
```
const personWritingThis = new Person("Jarrett", "21");
```
If you want to add a property to a constructor you add it to the constructor function prototype.

In HTML events are things that happen to elements, js can react to these events. Common events: onchange if an element was changed, onclick if an element was clicked, onmouseover if the user has their mouse over an element, onmouseout if the users mouse moves away from an element, onkeydown if a keyboard key is pressed, and onload when a browser finishes loading a page. 

Template strings are special strings defined with ` quotes that can contain quotes, and take variables and interpolate them. Interpolation is the insertion of something of a different nature into something else. They can also take in expressions and evaluate them in the string. 

JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard. Some integers round incorrectly if they are too big. Safe integers are all integers from -(2^53 - 1) to +(2^53 - 1). 

For comparisons,== is equal to, === is equal value and type, != is not equal, !== is not equal value or type. The ?? operator returns the first argument if it is not nullish (null or undefined). Otherwise it returns the second argument.

Use for in to loop through the properties of an object, use for of to loop through the properties of an iterable object.

A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values. Each value can only occur once in a Set. The values can be of any type, primitive values or objects. If you try adding duplicate values only the first instance will be added. A js map is a data structure for storing key-value pairs with flexible key types and insertion order preservation. It is like an object but it maintains order of insertion and can have the key be any type. Typed Arrays handle binary data, they hold fixed length of data, they are very fast. 

Iterating means looping over a sequence of elements. An Iterator is an object that provides a standard way to access elements sequentially. An Iterator must adheres to the Iterator Protocol: It must have a next() method. The next() method returns an object with two properties:

  The value property holds the next value in the iteration sequence.
  The done property returns false if there are more elements to iterate over, otherwise it returns true.

Empty an object by setting it to Null. Undefined and null are the smae value but undefined is of type undefined and Null is of type object. Destructuring is unpacking object properties into variables. Regular expressions are characters that form a search pattern. The syntax for using them is ```/pattern/modifier flags; ```. Im not getting into the specifics because i can always come back to the module. 

With operator precedence, operations with the same precedence (like * and /) are computed from left to right. Python and js handle errors similarly, try = try except = catch finally = finally raise = throw. Python is generally stricter and has more built in errors, and Java script is more dynamic and can have more surprises. Js returns an error object with name and message. 

With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment.

In HTML, the global scope is the window object.

Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope (either the global scope or function scope) before code execution, this is done by default. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations, so you can use a variable before its declaration but if you use a variable before initialization you get an error, if the variable is made with let and const they are hoisted but unlike with var they arenâ€™t able to be used before declaration.
