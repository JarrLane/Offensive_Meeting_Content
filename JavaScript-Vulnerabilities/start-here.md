Hello, welcome to my 2nd summer project where I learn and also teach the cybersecurity club. In this section I want to focus on JavaScript vulnerabilities. JavaScript is widely used and is considered to be very flexible and powerful
while also containing many vulnerabilities, and it is a great language to get used to for CTF, bug bounty, web security, and more. What I will do is first learn/teach javascript itself so I have a basic understanding, then I will get into
the vulnerabilities such as prototype pollution and xss (more to come), where I will explain the vulnerability and even try to make some labs which I will package into dockerr for others to try. I hope you like my content, 
thank you for reading.
